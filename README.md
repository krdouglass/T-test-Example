# T-test Example
The purpose of the R script is to demonstrate a T-test 
statistical analysis. This was made mostly for my own reference and as a way 
to practice, so it is far from perfect or comprehensive, but I will share it 
here for others who may find it helpful.

A T-test is a statistical test for estimating how a quantitative dependent variable
changes according to a categorical independent variable. 
The T-test determines whether there is a difference in means of the groups at each level 
of the independent variable.

The null hypothesis (H0) of the T-test is no difference in means, 
and the alternate hypothesis (Ha) is that the means are different from one another.
